# Group-Policy-Management-Homelab

### [Pictoral Walkthrough Demonstration]

<h2>Description</h2>
 In this lesson I will discuss and demonstrate Group Policy Management found in Active Directory. The plan is to create and set 
 up GPOs (Group Policy Objects). Then the other plan is to implement the GPOs we have create. The purpose of group policy is to allow an administrator to 
 have centralized control of users and computers on a network. 

 <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
   For this lab we will not get into how to install virtual box or Active Directory. Oracle Box should be downloaded and installed, Windows Server 19 
   should have been downloaded and installed. Windows 10 should have been installed and Active Directory Domain Services be installed and configured 
   before this lab configuration.

# Group-Policy-Management-Homelab

### [Pictoral Walkthrough Demonstration]

<h2>Description</h2>
 In this lesson I will discuss and demonstrate Group Policy Management found in Active Directory. The plan is to create and set 
 up GPOs (Group Policy Objects). Then the other plan is to implement the GPOs we have create. The purpose of group policy is to allow an administrator 
 to have centralized control of users and computers on a network. 

 <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
   For this lab we will not get into how to install virtual box or Active Directory. Oracle Box should be downloaded and installed, Windows Server 19 
   should have been downloaded and installed. Windows 10 should have been installed and Active Directory Domain Services be installed and configured 
   before this lab configuration.

 <h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>
  -<b>Microsoft Windows 10 Pro</b>
  
- <b>Oracle Virtual Box</b>
 - <b>Windows Server 19</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<p align="center"> First after we have entered into Windows Server 19 is go to Add Roles and Features and after you have checked Active Directory 
                   Domain Services go to Group Policy Managment and ensure both of these features are installed into the server.<br/>

 <p align="center"> Next inside the Windows Server VM go to the search prompt and type  "Group Policy Management Console and open. 
                    Our intention is to change the group policy. So within the console you need to extend your domain and find Group Policy Object. 
                    Right Click the Oject and then go to edit. This should open Group Policy Managment Editor. This is where you can create
                   different policies for your domain.
